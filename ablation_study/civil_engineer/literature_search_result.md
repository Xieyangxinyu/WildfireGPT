In the midst of increasing concerns about wildfire risks and climate change impacts, several studies shed light on effective forest management strategies that might benefit areas like Covington, VA. 

First, research by Stevens et al. (2020) explores the implications of managed wildfires over a 47-year period in montane forests of North America. Their findings suggest that managed wildfire can significantly alter vegetation structure and potentially improve soil moisture availability and water storage, even though the effects can be context-dependent. This study could be pivotal for managing Covington’s forests, particularly in strategies aimed at enhancing drainage efficiency and perhaps even reducing wildfire risks by managing tree densities and undergrowth (Stevens et al., 2020).

Secondly, Hansen et al. (2019) study the impact of fire management strategies on subalpine fire and forests in Grand Teton National Park. Their research indicates that while 21st-century climate change will likely increase fire activity, using managed wildfire instead of suppression tactics does not adversely affect forest preservation in subalpine regions. This suggests that similar management practices could be adapted for Covington, focusing on using natural fire regimes to maintain forest health and stability without compromising property safety (Hansen et al., 2019).

Lastly, Loudermilk et al. (2016) emphasize the role of fuel treatments not just in managing wildfires but also in enhancing the resilience of forest carbon stocks under climate change. Their analysis suggests that strategic fuel management can mitigate fire severity and foster the growth of fire-resistant and drought-tolerant tree species, contributing to the overall resilience and carbon storage of forests. For Covington, adopting such fuel treatments could bolster structural resilience against wildfires and help in maintaining ecological balance (Loudermilk et al., 2016).
