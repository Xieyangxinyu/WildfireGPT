In the face of increasing wildfire threats, particularly near critical infrastructure like power grids, the literature presents several comprehensive strategies for vegetation management and risk mitigation to enhance forest health and safety. For instance, Hvenegaard (2014) emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring and data collection at fuel treatment sites to effectively manage vegetation and reduce wildfire risks. This approach is essential for areas like Covington, VA, where maintaining transmission line clearance and grid resilience is critical (Hvenegaard, 2014).

Adding to the discussion, Dale (2006) critiques the current wildfire management policies, which mainly focus on fire suppression, leading to denser vegetation and more intense fires. Dale proposes the adoption of Wildland Fire Use (WFU), which leverages natural fires to meet specific resource management objectives, thus improving forest health and reducing management costs over time. This method could be particularly useful in maintaining healthier forests around power grids, ensuring a more resilient ecosystem against wildfires (Dale, 2006).

Further north in Canada, Westhaver, Revel, and Hawkes (2007) introduce the FireSmart®-ForestWise approach, which balances wildfire risk reduction with wildlife habitat conservation. Although this study is centered on Jasper National Park, its principles can be adapted to manage the wildland/urban interface around Covington, ensuring that fuel treatments do not only focus on fire risk but also take into account ecological sustainability and wildlife needs (Westhaver, Revel, & Hawkes, 2007).

These studies collectively offer a nuanced view of how vegetation management and wildfire risk mitigation can be implemented around critical infrastructure like power grids not just to protect against fires but also to promote an ecologically balanced approach that supports both human and wildlife needs.
