**Step 1**: I will begin by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI) dataset. This will focus on understanding the future trends in fire danger, particularly for the Mid-Century period (2045 - 2054). Analyzing these future projections, and comparing them against the historical period (1995 - 2004), will help us anticipate changes in wildfire risk near your area in Virginia.

**Step 2**: Next, I will examine the Long term fire history records. This dataset will provide vital insights into the historical patterns and cycles of wildfire activity in the broader North American region over centuries. Understanding these long-term trends will help in assessing the natural fire regimes and their impacts on ecosystems, which is crucial for managing forest landscapes effectively.

**Step 3**: Concurrently, I will conduct a literature search focused on wildfire management and ecological resilience in forest ecosystems. This will include finding scientific studies that discuss successful strategies for vegetation management, biodiversity preservation, and wildfire prevention in areas with similar ecological and climatic conditions to Covington, VA.

**Step 4**: Based on the insights obtained from the data analyses and scientific literature, I will develop a set of tailored recommendations. These will be aimed at enhancing the ecological resilience of your forest, improving habitat connectivity, and implementing effective wildfire risk mitigation strategies to protect properties within the next 5 to 10 years.

This plan will help ensure that your forest management strategy aligns well with the evolving dynamics of wildfire risks and ecological demands.
