You can access the website: https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**",

Title: ALPINE FIRES 2003: REHABILITATION AND RECOVERY OF PUBLIC LAND\nAuthors: P Jacobs et al.\nYear: 2003.0\nAbstract: The Alpine Fires of 2003 burnt through over 1.1 million hectares of mostly public land in eastern Victoria over a period of over 60 days before being brought under control. The fires extended throughout the Australian Alps into New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, burning in total, over 1.8 million hectares. Recovery and rehabilitation of natural and cultural values, managing visitor use and repair or replacement of built assets affected by the fire is a task of major proportions, requiring careful planning and targeted funding. This paper presents a process to rapidly identify values at risk from potentially threatening processes as a result of the fire, manage visitor use and prioritise and program post fire management response. In Victoria, post fire recovery and rehabilitation on public land started immediately the fire was brought under control with the establishment of seven rehabilitation teams throughout the fire area. The key components of the rehabilitation program were: Containment line rehabilitation Efforts to contain the fires resulted in the construction of over 6000 km of containment line to a range of standards. The initial objective was to stabilise disturbed soils ahead of any significant rain events, followed by full rehabilitation. Rehabilitation guidelines for disturbances were developed. Recovery Planning Recovery plans were developed for seven units within the fire area. Fundamental to the fire rehabilitation planning was the preparation of value sets, risk assessment and community consultation to determine: \u2022 Priority areas for stabilising and rehabilitation of disturbances; \u2022 Management strategies to assist ecological recovery and protection of cultural and natural heritage values; \u2022 Built assets in need of repair or replacement; and \u2022 Priority areas to assess and re-open for public use as soon as possible for visitors and to support the affected tourism industry. The individual unit plans were then synthesised and summarised into a Statewide Ecological and Cultural Recovery Plan, asset replacement plans and opening strategies which programmed funds made available from Government for bushfire recovery.\n\n2. Title: Postfire Management on Forested Public Lands of the Western United States\nAuthors: Robert Beschta et al.\nYear: 2004.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00495.x\nAbstract: Forest ecosystems in the western United States evolved over many millennia in response to distur- bances such as wildfires. Land use and management practices have altered these ecosystems, however, including fire regimes in some areas. Forest ecosystems are especially vulnerable to postfire management practices be- cause such practices may influence forest dynamics and aquatic systems for decades to centuries. Thus, there is an increasing need to evaluate the effect of postfire treatments from the perspective of ecosystem recovery. We examined, via the published literature and our collective experience, the ecological effects of some common postfire treatments. Based on this examination, promising postfire restoration measures include retention of large trees, rehabilitation of firelines and roads, and, in some cases, planting of native species. The following practices are generally inconsistent with efforts to restore ecosystem functions after fire: seeding exotic species, livestock grazing, placement of physical structures in and near stream channels, ground-based postfire log- ging, removal of large trees, and road construction. Practices that adversely affect soil integrity, persistence or recovery of native species, riparian functions, or water quality generally impede ecological recovery after fire. Although research provides a basis for evaluating the efficacy of postfire treatments, there is a continuing need to increase our understanding of the effects of such treatments within the context of societal and ecological goals for forested public lands of the western United States.\n\n3. Title: Wildfire Policy and Public Lands: Integrating Scientific Understanding with Social Concerns across Landscapes\nAuthors: MICHAEL P. DOMBECK, JACK E. WILLIAMS, CHRISTOPHER A. WOOD\nYear: 2004.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00491.x\nAbstract: Efforts to suppress wildfires have become increasingly problematic in recent years as costs have risen, threats to firefighter safety have escalated, and detrimental impacts to ecosystems have multiplied. Wildfires that escape initial suppression often expand into large, high-intensity summer blazes. Lost is the legacy of smaller fires that likely burned outside extreme weather and fuel conditions and resulted in less severe impacts. Despite the recognized need for modifications to existing policies and practices, resource agencies have been slow to respond. The spread of exotic species, climate change, and increasing human development in wildlands further complicates the issue. New policies are needed that integrate social and ecological needs across administrative boundaries and broad landscapes. These policies should promote a continuum of treatments with active management and reduction of fuel hazard in wildland-urban interface zones and reintroduction of fire in wildlands. Management goals should focus on restoration of the long-term ecological health of the land. Projects that reduce fuel loads but compromise the integrity of soil, water supplies, or watersheds will do more harm than good in the long run. Despite significant ecological concerns, learning to live with fire remains primarily a social issue that will require greater political leadership, agency innovation, public involvement, and community responsibility.",
