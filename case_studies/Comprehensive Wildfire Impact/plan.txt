**Step 1: Analyze Long-term Fire History Records**
- Review long-term fire history records to assess the frequency and intensity of past wildfires over the last 50+ years. Identify recurring patterns or significant changes in wildfire activity.

**Step 2: Examine the Fire Weather Index (FWI)**
- Analyze the Fire Weather Index to understand current and projected fire danger levels based on weather conditions. Focus on trends in the index over time and the impact of climatic changes on fire behavior and risks.

**Step 3: Literature Search**
- Conduct a literature search for scientific papers and studies relevant to wildfire risks in areas similar to Mount Bigelow. Focus on effective mitigation strategies, ecological impacts, and economic effects of wildfires.

**Step 4: Develop Recommendations**
- Provide recommendations based on the dataset analysis and literature findings. Focus on engineering solutions for mitigation, ecological conservation strategies, and economic loss minimization approaches.
