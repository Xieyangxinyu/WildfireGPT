Location We used a natural experiment created over time by the unique desert island geography of southern Arizona. Methods We sampled tree establishment dates in two sites on Rincon Peak and another site in the Santa Catalina Mountains. The influence of regional moisture patterns was investigated by examining synchrony among tree age peaks and periods of favourable moisture. The influence of fire was investigated by examining the relationship between local fire histories and age peaks. Results Tree age peaks (recruitment events) were synchronized with periods of reduced fire frequencies, suggesting that periods of reduced fire activity allowed time for young trees to develop fire-resistant characteristics. For example, two age peaks (1670s\u00e2\\x80\\x931680s and 1770s\u00e2\\x80\\x931780s) in the Rincon Peak-north site coincided with a period of reduced fire frequency. These age peaks were absent in the Rincon Peak-south site where fires were more frequent during that time. All three sites had age peaks in the early 19th century, coinciding with regional climate variability (i.e. El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o Southern Oscillation patterns) that reduced fire activity. Main conclusions Historically prior to fire suppression, the survivorship, and thus cohort establishment, of ponderosa pine was ultimately determined by local fire history patterns. The importance of fire as a tree establishment regulator highlights the need to use fire at appropriate intervals not just to restore but to maintain healthy forests.'}, {'Paper': 'Iniguez et al., (2008), Topography affected landscape fire history patterns in southern Arizona, USA, Forest Ecology and Management, 256(3), 295-303, 10.1016/j.foreco.2008.04.023', 'Abstract': 'Fire histories contribute important information to contemporary fire planning, however, our knowledge is not comprehensive geographically. We evaluated the influence of topography on fire history patterns in two contrasting landscapes within the Santa Catalina Mountains of southeastern Arizona. Multiple fire-scarred trees from randomly selected 2-ha plots were used to develop plot composite mean fire intervals (PCMFIs) within the Butterfly Peak (BP) and Rose Canyon (RC) landscapes. BP is dominated by steep, northerly aspects and presence of potential fire spread barriers (exposed rock bluffs and scree slopes). RC is dominated by more gentle and southerly aspects with relatively few fire barriers. Within each landscape, PCMFIs did not differ significantly between aspect classes from A.D. 1748 to 1910 (BP:\u00c2\\xa0p\u00c2\\xa0=\u00c2\\xa00.73 and RC:\u00c2\\xa0p\u00c2\\xa0=\u00c2\\xa00.57). Pooled PCMFIs in the gentler RC landscape were, however, significantly shorter (p\u00c2\\xa0<\u00c2\\xa00.001) than in the steeper BP landscape. The frequency of relatively widespread fires (i.e., number of fire years when ?2 plots scarred) was similar between landscapes, but fires in the gentler RC landscape were significantly larger (p\u00c2\\xa0=\u00c2\\xa00.033). The higher frequency of large fires (i.e., fires that burned >75% of the landscape) in RC resulted in more area burned over time and shorter fire intervals at individual plots. Conversely, smaller fires in the dissected BP landscape resulted in less area burned and longer periods between fires at individual plots. The different topographies in the two landscapes likely result in different wind intensities, fuel moistures, and fuel/vegetation types\u00e2\\x80\\x94and consequently, different historical fire spread patterns. Our conclusion is that fire history patterns are not influenced primarily by stand-scale topography, but rather by the topographic characteristics of the broader, surrounding landscape.'}]}]\nThis data is extracted from the International Multiproxy Paleofire Database (IMPD), an archive of fire history data derived from natural proxies such as tree scars and charcoal and sediment records.

Stand-replacing fire disturbances are under-appreciated natural events that have been shaping fire-dependent ecosystems for millennia, and their ecosystem benefits are being compromised by management actions that carry unintended consequences. Mimicking the spatial, temporal, and structural heterogeneity of these fire effects through management is not possible. Moreover, fire management actions such as forest thinning, mastication, and postfire logging are creating novel fire regimes at the expense of historical ones. Dramatic improvements in fire management and public perceptions of wildfire are needed to accommodate wildfires where they are beneficial. We provide several closing recommendations for addressing public safety concerns and ecological use of fire in natural areas.\n\n2. Title: Mapping Wildfire Hazards and Risks\nAuthors: R. Sampson, R.

Title: Wildfire Exposure Analysis on the National Forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA\nAuthors: Alan A. Ager et al.\nYear: 2013.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01911.x\nAbstract: We analyzed wildfire exposure for key social and ecological features on the national forests in Oregon and Washington. The forests contain numerous urban interfaces, old growth forests, recreational sites, and habitat for rare and endangered species. Many of these resources are threatened by wildfire, especially in the east Cascade Mountains fire-prone forests. The study illustrates the application of wildfire simulation for risk assessment where the major threat is from large and rare naturally ignited fires, versus many previous studies that have focused on risk driven by frequent and small fires from anthropogenic ignitions. Wildfire simulation modeling was used to characterize potential wildfire behavior in terms of annual burn probability and flame length. Spatial data on selected social and ecological features were obtained from Forest Service GIS databases and elsewhere. The potential wildfire behavior was then summarized for each spatial location of each resource. The analysis suggested strong spatial variation in both burn probability and conditional flame length for many of the features examined, including biodiversity, urban interfaces, and infrastructure. We propose that the spatial patterns in modeled wildfire behavior could be used to improve existing prioritization of fuel management and wildfire preparedness activities within the Pacific Northwest region.",

(2013) analyze wildfire exposure for various social and ecological features in the Pacific Northwest, demonstrating the use of wildfire simulation for risk assessment. This study highlights the importance of characterizing potential wildfire behavior to prioritize fuel management and preparedness activities, which could be similarly applied to the Mount Bigelow area (Ager et al., 2013).\n\nThese studies underscore the complexity of wildfire management and the necessity of integrating ecological understanding with community safety and resource management strategies.\n\n**References:**\n- DellaSala, D. et al.

Title: Economic Impacts of Wildfire\nAuthors: John Diaz\nYear: 2012.0\nAbstract: As wildfires are growing in scale and duration, and increasing numbers of communities are affected, we need a clearer understanding of how wildfires affect economies and communities. Wildland fire impacts are often described in terms of lives threatened, structures and homes lost or damaged, overall suppression costs, and damage to the natural resource base on which many rural communities rely. This fact sheet shares results from two studies to illustrate economic impacts that reach beyond the primary indicators of suppression costs and homes lost. This information can help public officials, community leaders, and local citizens understand the larger wildfire impacts on economies and society.\n\n2. Title: Chapter 13 \u2013 Flight of the Phoenix: Coexisting with Mixed-Severity Fires\nAuthors: Dominick DellaSala et al.\nYear: 2015.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5849/forsci.16-999\nAbstract: Throughout this book we present a compelling case for the ecological importance of mixed-severity wildfires in forests (though some chaparral systems currently experience too much fire), including, in many cases, megafires from western North America. Stand-replacing fire disturbances are under-appreciated natural events that have been shaping fire-dependent ecosystems for millennia, and their ecosystem benefits are being compromised by management actions that carry unintended consequences. Mimicking the spatial, temporal, and structural heterogeneity of these fire effects through management is not possible. Moreover, fire management actions such as forest thinning, mastication, and postfire logging are creating novel fire regimes at the expense of historical ones. Dramatic improvements in fire management and public perceptions of wildfire are needed to accommodate wildfires where they are beneficial. We provide several closing recommendations for addressing public safety concerns and ecological use of fire in natural areas.\n\n3. Title: Changes in potential wildland fire suppression costs due to restoration treatments in Northern Arizona Ponderosa pine forests\nAuthors: Ryan Fitch et al.\nYear: 2018.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.11.006\nAbstract: Abstract Wildfire suppression costs have been increasing since the early 1970's. With growing concern over wildfire suppression costs, our analysis addresses restoration treatment effectiveness in reducing wildfire suppression costs. We examine past fires across the Northern Arizona landscape to determine fire behavior characteristics that are significant in predicting wildfire suppression costs and capable of being modeled in fire simulations prior to wildfire events. We find burn severity metrics to be significant in predicting wildfire suppression costs. Three proposed treatment alternatives for the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) are analyzed to determine treatment effectiveness and policy implications in reducing burn severity metrics and wildfire suppression costs. The more aggressive treatments are more effective in reducing wildfire suppression costs except in the case of sever wind and weather events.",
