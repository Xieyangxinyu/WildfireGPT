**Step 1: Analyze Long-term Fire History Records**
- Analyze the long-term fire history records to assess historical wildfire trends in Denver over the past 10-50 years. This helps understand changes in wildfire frequency, size, and intensity, providing a historical context for current risk levels.

**Step 2: Review Climate Models and Projections (RCP 8.5 scenario)**
- Examine climate models and projections under the RCP 8.5 scenario to forecast potential future wildfire risks in the medium-term (10-30 years). Focus on how increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns could impact wildfire occurrences and intensity, specifically affecting transmission lines.

**Step 3: Literature Search**
- Conduct a literature search focusing on studies related to wildfire risks in similar climatic and geographical regions as Denver. Include reviewing successful mitigation strategies and risk assessment methodologies.

**Step 4: Recommendations**
- Based on the analysis of the datasets and literature review, provide recommendations tailored to mitigate the risks of wildfires to critical energy infrastructure in Denver. This includes strategic planning for infrastructure protection and suggestions for adapting to increased fire risks due to climate change.
