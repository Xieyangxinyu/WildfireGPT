You can access the website: https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**",

Title: Modeling prescribed burns to serve as regional firebreaks to allow wildfire activity in protected areas\nAuthors: Roger Suffling, Anne Grant, Rob Feick\nYear: 2008.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.043\nAbstract: Management around wilderness parks ideally requires thorough fire suppression in proximate settled and commercially exploited lands and natural fire within protected areas. To satisfy these requirements, we explored a potential regional firebreak (firewall) based on a series of prescribed burns in Quetico Provincial Park in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Fire managers were recruited each to independently devise a regional firebreak using simulated prescribed burns. The experts\u2019 five designs consisted of between 9 and 25 prescribed burns, set over periods ranging from 3 to 8 years, and covering from 7900 to 26,100 ha. Each wildlife ignition was run after the entire firebreak was created and the vegetation was reclassified to account for post-fire vegetation re-growth. The potential efficacy of each design was tested using worst-case historical weather and 100 random ignitions in the Prometheus fire growth simulation model. Without a firewall, 100 ignitions resulted in 69 fires escaping the park and consuming 483,900 ha of forest beyond the park boundary. The firewall designs were all effective, reducing the area burned outside the park to between 15,400 and 35,400 ha. There was a 77\u201390% reduction in the number of fires escaping the firewall areas and an average reduction of fire area beyond the park of 92%. Moreover, one can map the geographic weak points in each design, which encourages iterative firebreak design improvements. For instance, firewalls set nearer the park boundary allowed fewer fires to start between the firewall and the boundary, so increasing firebreak effectiveness. The cost of the above systems can be regarded as taking preventative measures against the risk of future economic loss, and the modeling approach reduces the uncertainties in associated decision making.\n\n2. Title: Fuelbreaks for Wildland Fire Management: A Moat or a Drawbridge for Ecosystem Fire Restoration\nAuthors: Timothy Ingalsbee\nYear: 2005.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.0101085\nAbstract: The classic definition of a fuelbreak is \u201ca strategically located, wide block or strip on which a cover of dense, heavy, or flammable vegetation has been permanently changed to one of lower fuel volume and reduced flammability\u201d (Green 1977). New terms have been created in recent years to describe allegedly new kinds of fuelbreaks, such as \u201cshaded fuelbreaks\u201d (Agee et al 2000), \u201cDefensible Fuel Profile Zones\u201d (Olson 1997, Weatherspoon and Skinner 1996), and \u201cFuel Management Zones\u201d (Fairbanks 2003). ::: ::: Given Green\u2019s (1977) generic definition of fuelbreaks, managers have the ability to explore a wider range of designs, methods, and uses for fuelbreaks than has been offered in the typical fuelbreak proposals of the past. By reconceptualizing fuelbreaks and using a genuinely collaborative planning process, it is possible for land managers to develop fuelbreak projects that address the concerns of critics while also meeting the needs of fire managers. A necessary first step in this process is to understand the criticisms that have been raised in the past.\n\n3. Title: Fire in Protected Areas - the Effect of Protection and Importance of Fire Management\nAuthors: Paulo Pereira et al.\nYear: 2012.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5755/j01.erem.59.1.856\nAbstract: Fires are important but socially and economically unwanted disturbances of the ecosystems. They cannot be considered as a problem, they are global phenomena. Protected areas are created to protect biodiversity, and strict protection is often applied, forgetting that fire had shaped that that we aim to protect. This harsh protection is producing important changes in the protected habitats and is increasing their vulnerability to destructive wildfires. Thus, it is of major interest to incorporate fire management in the protected areas plan, including the (re)use of prescribed fire and traditional burning in order to reintroduce fire regimens, fundamental to the landscape sustainability. This incorporation represents an enormous step in the habitats sustainability. Policies should be more focused on fire prevention than on its suppression.

Here's how the findings from the selected papers relate to your concern about establishing firebreaks around critical infrastructure and managing vegetation:\n\n1. **Modeling Prescribed Burns as Firebreaks**:\n   - Suffling, Grant, and Feick (2008) demonstrated the use of prescribed burns to create effective regional firebreaks around protected areas. Their study showed that firebreaks, strategically placed through prescribed burns, significantly reduced the number of wildfires escaping protected areas and the total area burned outside these regions. This approach can be adapted to protect critical infrastructure such as transmission lines by establishing firebreaks that limit the spread of wildfires towards these assets.\n\n2. **Reconceptualizing Fuelbreaks**:\n   - Ingalsbee (2005) discusses the evolution of fuelbreak concepts, suggesting that modern fuelbreaks can be designed in more innovative and effective ways than traditional methods. By rethinking fuelbreaks as more than just cleared strips and incorporating varied vegetation management techniques, you can enhance the protective buffer around critical infrastructure, reducing both fuel volume and flammability.\n\n3. **Fire Management in Protected Areas**:\n   - Pereira et al.
