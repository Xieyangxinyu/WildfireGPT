Title: Dynamics of a Managed Oak Woodland in Northeastern Illinois\nAuthors: Amanda Stan, Lesley Rigg, Linda Jones\nYear: 2006.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[187:doamow]2.0.co;2\nAbstract: Abstract We examined the current composition and structure of a woodland in northeastern Illinois and evaluated the early effect of two prescribed burns. In an effort to increase white oak (Quercus alba L.) regeneration, managers are reintroducing fire into the woodland understory. We assessed canopy species and compared understory vegetation and light, along with soil nutrient characteristics, between a burned and an unburned area. In addition, we monitored transplanted white oak seedlings to better understand their growth and survivorship in the woodland. The canopy was dominated by white oak, but non-oak species, particularly slippery elm (Ulmus rubra Muhl.), ash (Fraxinus spp. L), and black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), dominated the smaller size classes. There were no differences in woody and herbaceous vegetation, soil, and light characteristics between the burned and unburned area. White oak regeneration was poor which appeared to be due to low understory light levels associated with high density...\n\n2. Title: Response of advance reproduction of oaks and associated species to repeated prescribed fires in upland oak-hickory forests, Missouri\nAuthors: Zhaofei Fan et al.\nYear: 2012.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.034\nAbstract: The Chilton Creek prescribed burn project was initiated in 1996 by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to restore native oak woodlands and test the effect of frequent, low intensity surface fires conducted in the dormant season (March\u2013April) on upland oak-hickory forests in the Ozarks of Missouri. Burning treatments on five sites totaling 1000 ha were initiated in 1998. The prescribed burn treatments included: annual burns (one site was burned annually) and periodic burns (four sites were burned with a mean fire return interval of approximately 4 years). Approximately 3000 stems of advance reproduction with basal diameters 615.0 cm were measured in 1997 (pre-burn), and remeasured in 1998, 2001 and 2007 as the prescribed burn treatments proceeded. Mortality and changes in average and aggregate total height between 1997 and 2007 were analyzed for fourteen selected tree species. Over a ten-year period prescribed burning reduced stem density, mean height and aggregate height by 57%, 36% and 67%, respectively. However, individual tree species responded differently to the repeated burns. Oaks exhibited moderate mortality (36\u201354%) compared to hickories, sassafras and winged elm, all of which experienced relatively low mortality (18\u201335%). Flowering dogwood, shortleaf pine, blackgum and other minor species incurred higher mortality (60\u201376%). Oaks generally had slightly lower reductions in mean height and aggregate height than associated species with the exception of shortleaf pine, but the differences were mostly non-significant. Repeated burning tended to favor the white oak species (white oak, post oak, chinkapin oak) more than the red oak species (black oak, scarlet oak), although the differences were minor. Shortleaf pine was the only species to show increases in mean height following the\n\n3. Title: A Review on the Dynamics of Prescribed Fire, Tree Mortality, and Injury in Managing Oak Natural Communities to Minimize Economic Loss in North America\nAuthors: Daniel Dey, Callie Schweitzer\nYear: 2018.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/f9080461\nAbstract: The long history of fire in North America spans millennia and is recognized as an important driver in the widespread and long-term dominance of oak species and oak natural communities. Frequent wildfires from about 1850 to 1950 resulted in much forest damage, and gained fire a negative reputation. The lack of fire for the past nearly 100 years due to suppression programs is now indicted as a major cause of widespread oak regeneration failures and loss of fire-dependent natural communities. The use of prescribed fire is increasing in forest management and ecosystem restoration. An understanding of fire effects on trees can provide the basis for the silviculture of restoring and sustaining oak ecosystems. We present an overview of fire-tree wounding interactions, highlight important determinants of fire injury and damage, and discuss several practical situations where fire can be used to favor oak while minimizing damage and devaluation of the forest. We also identify stages in stand development, regeneration methods, and management objectives for which fire has the potential of causing substantial damage and recommend preferred alternative practices.",

You can access the website:https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**",
