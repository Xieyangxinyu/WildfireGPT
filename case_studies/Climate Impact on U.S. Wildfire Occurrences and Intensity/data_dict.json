You can access the website: https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**",
        "llm_response": "**LLM Response**\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) projections for Boston, Massachusetts, indicate a relatively stable trend in wildfire risk over the coming decades, with a slight increase towards the end of the century. Historically (1995-2004), the FWI values ranged from low in spring, autumn, and winter to medium in summer. These trends are projected to continue into the mid-century (2045-2054) and end-of-century (2085-2094), with a notable increase in the summer FWI by the end of the century, indicating a shift from low to medium risk.\n\nThis trend suggests that while the overall wildfire risk remains low to medium, there is an upward trajectory in the summer months, which could imply a need for increased vigilance and preparedness during this season.
