Please analyze and interpret fire incident numbers in [specified region] in the style of a research scientist in 100 words or less:
- Explain what these fire incident numbers indicate about current fire risks.
- Contextualize your data. How do these values relate to [your client's specific query or concern]? For example, how does the trend impact the user's community or industry? What's the broader impact on the people and the economy?
- Offer insights based on these trends. 
- Provide the link to the data source.
- Remind the client that fire incident counts are only one aspect of fire history and that the data may not be comprehensive. For burn severity, the client can refer to USGS data on burn severity: https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov.
